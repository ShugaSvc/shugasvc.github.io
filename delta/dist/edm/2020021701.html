        <p style="text-align: left; margin:20px;">Hi Shugarers,</p>


        <p style="text-align: left; margin:20px;">It has come to my attention that there had been some delays in the
            cash redemption process due to hiccups involving bank integration. That said, it's only right that an
            official update come from me. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin:20px;">
            First off, I would like to personally extend my sincere apologies on behalf of the company for the
            inconvenience caused. We started experiencing technical issues with the integration a few weeks back and the
            team has been working hard to resolve it with the banks. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin:20px;">
            Some of you may have already received your redemptions but there is still a bulk that have yet to be
            transacted; of which the team is closely monitoring in order to resolve the issue as soon as possible. With
            the recent outbreak of the Covid-19, we weren't spared and it has only made everything harder by slowing
            things down. We humbly seek your patience in view of the current situation.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin:20px;">
            Nonetheless, users who have made redemptions on rewards other than cash are not affected. On this note, we
            will not be able to convert your current cash redemption into other rewards at this point of time as they
            are already being tracked by the system.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin:20px;">
            The company was founded with the sole purpose of giving back advertising dollars to the community. You are
            the reason why we exist and how we continue to grow also depends strongly on your support. The team strives
            hard to bring you more partner merchants and is always looking for more ways to allow you to earn Shuga.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin:20px;">
            The delays in what's rightfully yours are not in our DNA. I will use every possible resource to resolve this
            and get things back on track. With that, a new mission for the company is for Shuga to be even better than
            how things used to be.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin:20px;">
            I would like to assure that you will be notified immediately once the system is fully back on track. I hope
            you will continue to use the app to earn rewards as Shuga never expires.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; margin:20px;">
            Once again, thank you for your understanding in this matter. </p>
