                    should further note that there will likely be limits on how many times you can be eligible for Shuga
                    in various time periods (a day, a week, a month, etc.) for each action, and for each program.
                    Eligibility requirements for all programs may change without prior warning. Please do check the
                    Application, or relevant pages within the Shuga Platform for the most up-to-date information in

                    You agree to use the Application and Shuga Platform only for the actions required, and in compliance
                    with these Terms. We will not be liable for a failure to award Shuga under any circumstance, for any
                    reason, including due to errors in your mobile device or mobile network, failing to complete the
                    actions and/or failure to follow the stated directions. We cannot guarantee that eligibility dates
                    will not change without prior warning, and we therefore disclaim all responsibility for any failure
                    to award Shuga. All Shuga awarded shall be credited to your Shuga Wallet and can be viewed at the
                    History section of the Application.

                    There are various ways for you to earn Shuga through the Shuga Platform as set out below:
                  </p>

                    <li>
                      <h6>Shuga for Walk-ins</h6>
                      <p>
                        Shuga for walking-in can only be earned if you are physically present at eligible participating
                        walk-in locations that are open for business and active at the time you have the Application
                        open, your device has network reception while you are accessing the relevant pages in the
                        Application, and there are available Shuga for distribution at the time (“Walk-in Shuga Award”).
                        It should be noted that there may be certain restrictions on how often you can walk into a store
                        to earn Shuga and you should always check the Application for the most up-to-date information.
                        Please note that we are not liable for a failure in an Walk-in Shuga Award if the maximum Shuga
                        allocated to the relevant participating store has been awarded to other Account holders. You
                        should also note that the number of Shuga that will be awarded to you for walking into the same
                        participating store may change from time to time. You also agree by participating in the Walk-in
                        Shuga Award that the Company has no obligation to notify and inform you when there are no more
                        Shuga to be earned as the maximum Shuga allocated to the relevant participating store has been
                        fully awarded.

                      <h6>Shuga for Scans</h6>
                      <p>
                        Shuga for scans can be earned by using the scanning function on the Application (or similar
                        functions in the Shuga Platform as specified by the Company from time to time) to scan the bar
                        codes of participating products with your device’s camera while you are physically present at
                        eligible participating stores, and there are available Shuga for distribution at the time
                        (“Scan Shuga Awards”). The scanning function on the Application will only be available to you
                        when you and your device is detected to be physically within the eligible participating stores.
                        The scanning function on the Application will not be available to you if you are not physically
                        in the eligible participating stores. The identity of participating products and their locations
                        will be communicated to you from time to time through the Shuga Platform. It should be noted
                        that each participating product will have a limit on the number of times the relevant product
                        may be scanned in a specified time period which may be a day, a week or a month (as the case may
                        be), and there will also be limits on the time interval between each scan. Please scan the
                        participating products one at a time in order for the scanning function to be able to register
                        the participating product and process the same. Some time may be required between each scan.
                        Further, each participating product has a limited number of scans available for all Users of the
                        Application and the Shuga Platform. If the scan limit is reached, you will no longer be able to
                        earn Shuga for scanning that participating product. You should also note that the number of
                        Shuga that will be awarded to you for scanning the same participating product may change from
                        time to time.

                      <p>
                        You agree that by participating in the Scan Shuga Awards program, the Shuga Platform may access
                        your device’s camera, and that the Company will review the scans made by your device. In
                        addition, you also agree to use the Shuga Platform, the Scan Shuga Award and the Purchase Shuga
                        Award (as defined below) solely for the purpose of submitting scans to the Company, and to fully
                        follow and comply with the Terms. In particular, you agree that you will only scan participating
                        products at the locations listed in the Shuga Platform, unless you are otherwise directed by the
                        Shuga Platform. Further, the Company does not guarantee that the advertised products will always
                        be available for scanning at the published locations (e.g. a participating product may be out of
                        stock in the said participating location, etc.), or that bar codes will always be accurate.
                        Accordingly, please note that the Company disclaims any and all responsibility for any failed
                        scanning experiences, errors, or mistakes that may occur during a scanning attempt.
                        Additionally, we are not liable for a failure to award Shuga, including where such a failure
                        occurs due to the inaccuracy of the information we may receive from participating product
                        manufacturers and stores, or because there are no more Shuga to be earned as the maximum Shuga
                        allocated to the participating product has been fully awarded. By participating in the Scan
                        Shuga Awards, you agree that the Company is under no obligation to notify and inform you when
                        there are no more Shuga to be earned as the maximum Shuga allocated to the relevant
                        participating product has been fully awarded.

                      <p>
                        We will only award you Shuga for qualifying purchases that are not returned. Such qualifying
                        purchases are purchases of the participating product made from stores included in the Purchase
                        Shuga Awards, such purchases are not held in default or deemed fraudulent, and fully comply with
                        the Terms. Further information in relation to the participating products and the Purchase Shuga

                        Purchase Shuga Awards may not be awarded or redeemed until a certain time period (for example,
                        for returns associated with that relevant merchant participating in the Shuga Platform

                        will be indicated as pending in the History section and will be transferred to the Shuga Wallet
                        after the relevant time period has passed. If you make a return, the transaction is invalidated,
                        disputed, or does not settle for any reason prior to the Shuga, then some or all pending Shuga
                        will be deducted from your Account, as determined and at the sole and absolute discretion of the
                        Company. If you make a return for cash or, store credit, we will take away some or all of your

                    expressly sent by you should you choose to make such referrals. Please note though that messaging

                    successfully completed by the Referee in the first 30 days of Signing Up. The number of Bonus Shuga
                    to be awarded to the Referrer for each of the aforementioned milestones may be different for each
                    milestone, shall be determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Company, and may be

                      <h6>General Information regarding redemption of Shuga and Candie</h6>
                      <p>
                        Shuga and Candie may be used as soon as they are reflected in your Account balance or may be
                        accrued over time for later use prior to forfeiture or termination of the Shuga Platform. For
                        the avoidance of doubt, there is no expiry period for Shuga, Bonus Shuga and Candie. Some
                        Rewards may require additional time before they can be fulfilled. Refunds, exchanges and other
                        issues regarding the redeemed item are governed by the Reward supplier’s terms and conditions
                        applicable to the item, including any warranty, and are not our responsibility. Restrictions may
                        apply to certain Rewards and the terms specific to the Rewards are disclosed through the Shuga
                        Platform. Partners participating in the Shuga Platform are subject to change at any time. You
                        are responsible for the payment of any applicable taxes that may result from Rewards received as
                        part of the Shuga Platform. Rewards pictured within the Shuga Platform may not necessarily
                        reflect exact colors or models of actual Rewards due to model variations and/or manufacturer’s
                        updates.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Merchandise rewards that are not collected by you or are not eligible for self-collection will
                        be shipped within 14 business days from the date of the Reward redemption. Merchandise can only
                        be shipped to locations in Singapore. Some merchandise Rewards require a street address for
                        shipment. We reserve the right to substitute merchandise of equal or greater value in place of
                        unavailable merchandise, or to refund Shuga that were redeemed for unavailable merchandise. All
                        Rewards are provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including
                        but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or
                        non-infringement.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        To redeem Shuga and Candie for Rewards, you agree to comply with all applicable laws and to
                        abide by these Terms. We expressly reserve the right to retroactively reverse any rewards or
                        benefits granted to you for any prohibited conduct or violation of the Terms; you agree to
                        provide your full cooperation and prompt repayment under such circumstances.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you believe that Shuga, Candie or other awards were not properly accrued to your Account,
                        please notify us by using the <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> form on the Shuga Platform
                        within 30 days of when you think the error occurred. Please allow 30 days for any claims to be
                        researched and corrected as needed. Our determination will be final, and made in our sole and
                        absolute discretion. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee Shuga and Candie you believe should have
                        been accrued can be credited to you later, if we are unable to determine the precise location
                        you were in, or the action you took on the Application or at a store, at the time when you
                        believe the Shuga and Candie should have been credited. Among other reasons, technical problems
                        with a walk-in detection system may result in your action not being detected or verified
                        accurately by the Shuga Platform. While we try to prevent that from happening, neither we nor
                        our affiliates or business partners can be held liable for your inability to accrue Shuga,
                        Candie or other awards in such event.

                  <h6>Assignment.</h6>
                  <p>
                    We reserve the right to assign or transfer our rights and obligations under this Agreement. These
                    terms are personal to you and, as a result, you may not, without our prior written consent, assign
                    or transfer any of your rights and obligations under this Agreement.

                  <h6>Rights of third parties.</h6>
                  <p>
                    A person or entity who is not a party to these Terms shall have no right under the Contracts (Rights
                    of Third Parties) Act, Chapter 53B of Singapore, regardless of whether such person or entity has
                    been identified by name, as a member of a class or as answering a particular description. For the
                    avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Clause shall affect the rights of any permitted assignee or
                    transferee of these Terms.
                  </p>

                  <h6>Severability.</h6>
                  <p>
                    If any provision of these Terms is held invalid, unenforceable or illegal for any reason, these
                    Terms shall remain otherwise in full force apart from such provision which shall be deemed deleted.
                  </p>

                  <h6>Waiver.</h6>
                  <p>
                    No waiver of any breach of these Terms shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other or of any
                    subsequent breach. The failure of the Company to enforce at any time any of the Terms shall in no
                    way be interpreted as a waiver of such provision.
                  </p>

                  <h6>Entire Agreement.</h6>
