All Shuga awarded shall be credited to your Shuga Wallet and can be viewed at the History section of the Application.<br><br>There are various ways for you to earn Shuga through the Shuga Platform as set out below:<br><br><span style="color:#bd64b1"><strong>Shuga for Walk-ins</strong></span><br>Shuga for walking-in can only be earned if you are physically present at eligible participating walk-in locations that are open for business and active at the time you have the Application open, your device has network reception while you are accessing the relevant pages in the Application, and there are available Shuga for distribution at the time ("Walk-in Shuga Award").

Please scan the participating products one at a time in order for the scanning function to be able to register the participating product and process the same. Some time may be required between each scan. Further, each participating product has a limited number of scans available for all Users of the Application and the Shuga Platform.

Further, the Company does not guarantee that the advertised products will always be available for scanning at the published locations (e.g. a participating product may be out of stock in the said participating location, etc.), or that bar codes will always be accurate. Accordingly, please note that the Company disclaims any and all responsibility for any failed scanning experiences, errors, or mistakes that may occur during a scanning attempt. Additionally, we are not liable for a failure to award Shuga, including where such a failure occurs due to the inaccuracy of the information we may receive from participating product manufacturers and stores, or because there are no more Shuga to be earned as the maximum Shuga allocated to the participating product has been fully awarded.
