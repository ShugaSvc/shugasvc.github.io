                <!--What exactly is Shuga? Is it worth anything?-->
                <div>
                  <p>Shuga is a reward with monetary value.</p>
                  <p>Yes! Real money, 200 Shuga is valued at SGD$1.00 and can be used to redeem store gift vouchers & products you know and love! You can explore in our app the full list of rewards!</p>
                </div>

                <!--How can I earn Shuga?-->
                <div>
                  <p>1. Earn Shuga by simply walking into a partner store. They’re all listed on our application in order of proximity; you can also view our map to see what stores are offering Shuga near you!</p>

                  <p>2. Earn by scanning the barcode of products listed under ‘ Scan for Shuga’ inside our partner stores.</p>

                  <p>Once you find the item in the store and you are ready to scan, tap the item in the scan list. By clicking ‘Scan and Earn Shuga Now’ your phone’s camera will activate and you’ll see a white box with a pink line running through the middle. Line up the barcode with the box and pink line, and you’ll receive Shuga.</p>

                  <p>3. Earn Shuga as a purchase rebate from snapping partner store receipts.</p>

                  <p>You can submit receipts up to 24hours after the purchase is made, submit by opening the yellow receipt button on the bottom right-hand side, your phone’s camera will activate. Snap a nice clear picture and once submitted, it will go through a verification process.</p>
                </div>

                <!--When can I exchange my Shuga for real rewards?-->
                <div>
                  <p>You can redeem anytime you have enough to redeem a reward!</p>
                  <p>Some popular gift vouchers start at the value of 2000 Shuga.</p>
                </div>

                <!--Does Shuga expire like other rewards out in the market?-->
                <div>
                  <p>Shuga never expires you can continue to earn to redeem cool products from air flight tickets to Apple products!</p>
                </div>

                <!--What is Candie?-->
                <div>
                  <p>Candie is a fun way to earn tickets for the Shuga Wheel to win Shuga Boosters and Shuga! You can pick them up virtually anywhere in the world and or earn them by snapping non-partner receipts. For every dollar on a non-partner receipt, we reward you with 1 Candie, the maximum being 2000 per receipt. Non-Partner receipts must be from a valid printed receipt with the transaction made within 24hrs of submission.</p>
                </div>

                <!--I've just bought an item with a receipt value of $2,300. I know it's not a partner store but I only got 2,000 Candies instead of 2,300 Candies. Is there an error?-->
                <div>
                  <p>It's not an error; there is a cap of 2,000 Candies for every receipt snapped. That's still worth 10 spins! If you believe our system has granted you incorrect Candie amount, you simply flag the receipt in our application or contact us directly at <a href="mailto:hello@shuga.io">hello@shuga.io</a></p>
                </div>

                <!--How can I participate in the Shuga Wheel?-->
                <div>
                  <p>Simple! For very 200 Candies accumulated, you will be eligible to exchange a ticket to participate in the Shuga Wheel. So just keep snapping receipts for Candies, ANY receipts. Be it petrol, groceries, movies, dining or even luxury goods, as long as you snap the receipt on hand, you can earn Candies. Candies are also scattered all over the countries too to help you get a chance to spin sooner too!</p>
                </div>

                <!--What is Bonus Shuga vs Shuga?-->
                <div>
                  <p>Bonus Shuga is a reward that is granted to you for performing certain actions on our application (e.g. sign up). Bonus Shuga converts to Shuga that you can redeem for prizes when you reach 2000 Bonus Shuga.</p>
                </div>

                <!--I snapped a partner store receipt but I can‘t see my Shuga rebate?-->
                <div>
                  <p>Please check our ‘TERMS & CONDITIONS’ to find out if you are eligible for the Shuga rebate. Once you scan a partner receipt, it will remain under ‘pending receipts’ until the return or exchange policy of the merchant lapses!  Our rebate process can range from 2 days to 3 months as we rely on T&C of our partner stores. In an event of a cancellation, return or exchange of your purchase the rebate will not be awarded as Shuga is only given for completed orders.</p>
                  <p>If none of the above applies please contact our team!</p>
                </div>

                <!--My favourite retailers are not on the Shuga app.-->
                <div>
                  <p>Tell us who you love to shop with, and we will try our very best to talk to them so you can continue to stay loyal and rewarded when you shop with them. Email us <a href="mailto:hello@shuga.io">hello@shuga.io</a></p>
                </div>

                <!--What is Booster won from Shuga Wheel?-->
                <div>
                  <p>Congratulations! Boosters in the Shuga Wheel range from 1%-100%. Depending on what is activated, the Booster will boost your Shuga earnings relative to the Booster percentage you activated. Do remember to activate your Booster fast before it expires. There's also an expiry once the Booster is active. So during this period, visit more stores, scan more products and go on a shopping spree because the Booster can help you earn up to 100% more Shuga!</p>
                </div>

                <!--Can I use the app even when I'm overseas?-->
                <div>
                  <p>Yes! Candies are scattered all over the world, but we do not accept snapping of overseas receipts at the moment.</p>
                </div>

                <!--I‘m having trouble submitting my receipts.-->
                <div>
                  <p>For best result, please make sure your receipts are:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Flattened and upright (receipt texts are not tilted)</li>
                    <li>Receipt texts are clear</li>
                  </ol>
                </div>

                <!--I have flattened out my receipt and text are clear, but I still can't get any Candie?. Why?-->
                <div>
                  <p>There might be a few reasons why. Our artificial intelligence (A.I) needs to capture date, total amount, address and company name in order to award Candie and even Shuga. Good news is, almost every receipt contains the information required. Another reason why it might still not work is because our current A.I only understands the English language. So if the receipt is fully printed in any other language it might not be able to understand just yet. It's learning! Given some time it will be able to recognize and grant you Candie soon!</p>
                  <p>(Sorry, hand written receipts and charge slips are not accepted)</p>
                </div>

                <!--My receipt is too long for me to capture.-->
                <div>
                  <p>Some receipts can be very long, you can capture it by taking multiple pictures by clicking on the + icon in our receipt snapping page. Be sure to overlap some items to help our scanner match up the complete receipt image.</p>
                </div>

                <!--I cannot register with my email? Please help?-->
                <div>
                  <p>Please contact us directly by emailing <a href="mailto:hello@shuga.io">hello@shuga.io</a></p>

                <!--How much can I earn from referring my friends?-->
                <div>
                  <p>Referring your friends can help you earn a lot of Shuga!</p>
                  <p>When your friend downloads the application, you will be awarded 30% of their welcome Shuga instantly. Wait, it gets better, for the next month every time your referred friend earns Shuga by walking into a Shuga partner store or scans products for Shuga you will also be rewarded 30% of their reward. For the times they snap a partner store receipt, you’ll get 10% of their reward.  There is no limit on the number of friends you can refer so share the love!</p>
                </div>

                <!--Why didn't I get any Bonus Shuga when my friend has signed up and started visiting stores and snapping Partner Store's receipt?-->
                <div>
                  <p>We are sorry for any inconvenience caused. Referral Bonus will only be credited if it's the first time your friend downloads the app on a device and a first time account. If your friend has a previous account, it will not be eligible for the referral Bonus Shuga.</p>
                </div>

                <!--Why don't you allow cash back?-->
                <div>

                </div>
