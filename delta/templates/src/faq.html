                                    <p>Candies are a fun way to earn tickets to participate in Shuga High. You can pick
                                        them up virtually from anywhere in the world! Snapping of non-partner receipts
                                        is also a good way to collect Candies!</p>
                                    <p>Unlike Shuga, Candies do expire so please remember to utilize them in Shuga High.
                                        You will be able to see when your Candies are expiring in Shuga High.</p>

                                <!--What do I get from snapping a partner receipt?-->

                                    <p>You will receive Shuga rebate depending on the rebate amount given by the merchant!</p>
                                    <p>Take note that your receipts will remain under “pending receipts” UNTIL the return or exchange policy of the merchant lapses.
                                        We rely on the T&Cs of our partner stores; rebate process can range anything from 2 days to 3 months.
                                        In the event of any cancellation, return or exchange or your purchase, the rebate will not be awarded Shuga.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Your total number of receipts should not exceed 4 a day,
                                        inclusive of both partner and non-partner receipts.
                                        We also do not accept more than 2 receipts from one single merchant in a day.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                <div>
                                    <p>We reward you with 2 Candies for every $1 (capped at 400 Candies) as well as 1 Shuga per receipt.
                                        You may snap up to 4 non-partner receipts per day, with a limit of 2 receipts per merchant.
                                        In other words, we will only accept the first 2 receipts snapped from “Store A” and disregard any 3rd
                                        receipt snapped from “Store A”.</p>

                                    <p>Pick up Surprise Candies daily! That’s it! Once you have a daily streak going on,
                                        you will start to unlock multipliers that give you different amounts of Candies
                                        & Shuga per non-partner receipt snapped!</p>
                                    <p>Pick Candies consecutively for 3 days to receive x3 Candies per $1! We will also
                                        increase your Candies cap per receipt to 1,000 Candies (instead of 400
                                        Candies).</p>
                                    <p>Pick Candies consecutively for 6 days to receive 2 Shuga per non-partner receipt
                                        (instead of 1 Shuga)!</p>
                                    <p>Pick Candies consecutively for 9 days to receive x4 Candies per $1! We will also
                                        increase your Candies cap per receipt to 3,000 Candies (instead of 1,000 Candies
                                        from previous multiplier).</p>
                                    <p>Pick Candies consecutively for 13 days to receive 3 Shuga per non-partner receipt
                                        (instead of 2 Shuga from previous multiplier)!</p>

                                    <p>Unfortunately, no! You will need to maintain a 13 days streak in order to keep
                                        all multipliers unlocked. If you miss out on a day, your progress will be
                                        “reversed”.</p>
                                    <p>Eg. Peter has just unlocked all 4 multipliers after a 13-day streak in picking
                                        Candies up! However, he stopped picking Candies up for the next 3 days. What
                                        happens then?</p>
                                    <p>Don’t worry! We will not strip Peter of his entire streak! We will only deduct
                                        from Peter’s progress, reducing his 13-day streak to a 10-day streak. If Peter
                                        snaps a non-partner receipt then, he will not be entitled to multiplier that
                                        gives him x3 Shuga per non-partner receipt.</p>

                                    <p>Multipliers are automatic! Once the system recognizes that you have unlocked any

                                <div>
                                    <p>We try our best to accept as many merchant receipts as possible. Here
                                        are some guidelines:</p>
                                    <p>1. Receipts must be a valid printed receipt from Singapore retail, service
                                        and F&amp;B industry with the transaction made within 48 hrs of
                                        submission.<br/>
                                        2. We do not accept receipts for commercial, unpaid invoices, charge
                                        slips (e.g. EZ-link top ups, netts or AXS payments) and quotations.<br/>
                                        3. Receipts showing signs of modification or adjustment will strictly be
                                        rejected.<br/>
                                        4. Please do not upload receipts from a store that you work in. This applies to
                                        both partner and non-partner merchants.<br/>
                                        5. Avoid folding or leaving part of your receipt out intentionally.<br/>
                                        6. If your receipt is an online invoice, we will need to verify that the invoice
                                        contains a recognized merchant, date & time of purchase, products etc. Candies
                                        granted will be by a case-by-case basis so your receipt may be automatically
                                        reported for our system to verify.

                                    <p>Our algorithm will identify all snaps. Accounts with flagged risk may have their
